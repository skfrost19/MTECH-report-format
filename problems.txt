- The passage might not contain the answers to the query. This raise a question as how much cosine similarity is a good measure of the relevance of the passage to the query, in this ranking suffers.
- The passage contains multiple relevance, this leads to take into account some variance in the relevance of the passage to the query. This is not taken into account in the ranking.




i have following obervations
1. The RAG with nvidia-embed fails on the queries with multiple relevant documents or no relevance because the there is no threshold on cosine similarity score, and also i am doing argmax for score vector, so it is always giving a single 1 in the score vector.
2. HyDE seems to degrade the performance in terms of accuracy as the hypoyhetical query sometime generates no answer or very different answer from the query due to lack of knowledge.
