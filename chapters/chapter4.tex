% show the results of the model merging using SLERP
The comparison of base models with their fine-tuned versions can be seen in this section. Both fine-tuned versions on an average show better performance (accuracy) than their respective base models


\section{Gemini\_PMC}
% show the performance evaluation metrics
The performance evaluation metrics of the fine-tuned model are as follows:

\section{GPT2\_PMC}
% compare the merged model with the base models leaderboard.png
