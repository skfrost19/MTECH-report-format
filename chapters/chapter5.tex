\section{Conclusion}
This research presents a approach to document ranking by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\cite{rag} with Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE)\cite{hyde}. The key contributions and findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An innovative architecture that combines dense retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance ranking accuracy
    \item Implementation of HyDE technique that demonstrates significant improvements in handling ambiguous queries
    \item Empirical validation on the MS-MARCO\cite{ms-marco} dataset showing competitive performance metrics
    \item Successful integration of state-of-the-art models including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct\cite{qwen2.5} and NV-Embed-v2\cite{nvembed}
    \item Efficient optimization techniques that make the system practical for large-scale applications
\end{itemize}

The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methodology achieves superior performance compared to traditional ranking approaches, particularly in scenarios involving complex semantic understanding and contextual reasoning.
